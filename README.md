# Amazon.com-Clone
I created a clone of the Amazon.com homepage using only HTML and CSS. This project focuses on replicating .the core structure, design, and layout of the original Amazon website ðŸŽ¯. It includes a header with a navigation bar, a search bar, product sections, banners, and a footer â€“ all styled to look clean and responsive.
